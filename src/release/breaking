v0.18.184

## changes

- default to attributes instead of properties. This aligns with the possible upcoming Solid 2.0. Fixes a lot of problems and makes the code smaller.
- Finally understood a bunch of stuff and tunned the typescript setup. Typings are still work in progress.
- the playground switched to monaco, accepts typescript and defaults to TSX, providing pota typings!
- exports a `createReactiveSystem`, will use in dev-tools to hide dev-tools from reports.
- new `<Range start={0} stop={10} step={2}/>` component! by @boredofnames Thanks!
- Trying to setup releases, not sure if will work. Mostly to comment breaking changes, as api shape is being researched.
- minor bug fixes and improvements
- restructured the project
- add `cancelCleanup`
