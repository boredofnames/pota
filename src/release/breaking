# pota v0.18.184

## changes

- default to attributes instead of properties. This aligns with the possible upcoming Solid 2.0. Fixes a lot of problems and makes the code smaller.
- Finally understood a bunch of stuff and tunned the typescript setup. Typings are still work in progress, and some are wrong, at least the base is there.
- the playground switched to monaco, accepts typescript and defaults to TSX, providing pota typings!
- exports a `createReactiveSystem`, will use in dev-tools to hide dev-tools from report/inspect panels.
- new `<Range start={0} stop={10} step={2}/>` component! by @boredofnames Thanks!
- Trying to setup releases, not sure if will work. Mostly to comment breaking changes, as api shape is being researched and will most likely change
- everything is now namespaced, so theres no colisions between attibutes/properties/events/lifecycles/plugins
- minor bug fixes and improvements
- restructured the whole project
- add `cleanupCancel`
- supports rendering generators
