# pota v0.18.184

This release provides a proper typescript setup. Typings are a work in progress to. A major restructuring of the project structure, and small general minor bug fixes and improvements.

## changes

- Defaults to attributes instead of properties. This aligns with the possible upcoming Solid 2.0. Fixes a lot of problems by aligning with HTML, and makes the code smaller.
- Everything is now namespaced, so there are no collisions between attributes/properties/events/lifecycles/plugins
- Proper typescript setup. Typings are still work in progress
- The playground switched to monaco, accepts typescript and defaults to TSX, providing pota typings!
- exports a `createReactiveSystem`, will use in dev-tools to hide dev-tools from report/inspect panels.
- New `<Range start={0} stop={10} step={2}/>` component! by @boredofnames Thanks!
- Trying to setup releases, not sure if will work. Mostly to comment breaking changes, as api shape is being researched and will most likely change
- minor bug fixes and improvements
- supports rendering generators
