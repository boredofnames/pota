CONSIDER ALWAYS

- KEEP THE CODE READABLE, DO NOT COMPLICATE IT TOO MUCH
- CONSISTENCY ABOVE ALL
- SLOW AND SIMPLE IS BETTER THAN FAST AND HARD TO UNDERSTSAND

some day

	use:css

	documentation
	- PRIORITY - online tests, a page full of tests
	- PRIORITY - the attributes page is out of date
	- PRIORITY - restore publishing
	- improve it
	- light theme
	- add proper 404

	typescript
	- css typings
	- there are 936 errors

	tools
	- rethink the dev tools
	- mdx

	renderer
	- render generators instanceof GeneratorFunction;
	- async functions instanceof AsyncFunction;

	mutable
	- PRIORITY - support a readonly
	- improve the tracker
	- figure out a whitelist vs blacklist! use a whitelist
	- support set, maybe weakmap and weakset
	- defineProperty proxy trap
	- maybe doesnt need to recurse on initialization
	- consider allowing to catch Functions, so that way a memo can have properties and be a memo and a mutable at the same time

	html
	- maybe make a <WithDocument document={document}/> so stuff stops breaking with popups

	plugins
	- css plugin missbehaving

	typescript
	- type lib/solid.js
	- type jsx: components, children, elements
	- add props for input.indeterminate, video.srcObject,

	reactivity
	- PRIORITY - use internally runWithOwner more
	- PRIORITY - try to remove `options` object from root/memo/effects
	- recheck use of untrack / add forbidden signal read
	- figure out if possible to prevent writing to signals inside effects
	- derived/light signals (make signals easier to use)
	- diff array for when value comes and doesnt come from server
	- simplify the classes
	- maybe at compile time wrap in owned anything bellow a `await`, do similar to promises?
	- figure out if other things should be wrapped in `createReactiveSystem`
	- figure out if top level runs the same as when owned, or make top level owned, even if doesnt garbage collects
