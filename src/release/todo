CONSIDER ALWAYS

- KEEP THE CODE READABLE, DO NOT COMPLICATE IT TOO MUCH
- CONSISTENCY ABOVE ALL
- SLOW AND SIMPLE IS BETTER THAN FAST AND HARD TO UNDERSTSAND

some day

	- PRIORITY - try to remove `options` object from root/memo/effects
	- PRIORITY - a cleanup that can be canceled

	- recheck use of untrack / add forbidden signal read
	- figure out if possible to prevent writing to signals inside effects
	- derived/light signals (make signals easier to use)
	- diff array for when value comes and doesnt come from server
	- simplify the classes
	- maybe at compile time wrap in owned anything bellow a `await`, do similar to promises?
	- when `owner` is exported, it should be a reference to the real owner, instead of being the real owner.
	- figure out if other things should be wrapped in `createReactiveSystem`
	- figure out if top level runs the same as when owned, or make top level owned, even if doesnt garbage collects
