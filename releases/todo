TODO:

	Documentation:
	- light theme
	- improve directory

	Playground
	- import map
	- switch reactive library
	- LSP

	Reactivity:
	- abstract equals param on signals
	- add maverick https://github.com/maverick-js/signals

	Miscellaneous:
	- provide a rollup template
	- typings
 	- allow to use a class in createWebElementsGroup

BUGS:

	classList:
	- the name of the class is not reactive

	Router:
	- decide what to do with useParams
	- is not scrolling when reloading to a hash tag when used with `lazy`

FUTURE FEATURES:

	Mount:
	- support mount points as a selector

	Components:
	- provide fallback for collapse

	Router:
	- make the `path` reactive

	Compiler:
	- write a compiler to make the output smaller

	Optimizations:
	- change some for of for for in
	- merge effects on equal reactive values
	- functions that accept arguments of changing types should be split
	- get rid of the ReactiveMap class as is no longer checking for instanceof ReactiveMap
