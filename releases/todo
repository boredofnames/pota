	Miscellaneous:
	- typings

	fix me
	- the fragment being a symbol is just weird, fix makeCallback
	- something is up with the playground
	- recheck use of untrack
	- add forbidden signal read
 	- remove the placeholders from the array

	now
	- mutable: tracker
	- mutable: figure out a whitelist vs blacklist

POSSIBLE FEATURES:

	classList:
	- the name of the class is not reactive

	Mount:
	- support mount points as a selector

	Components:
	- provide fallback for collapse
	- provide fallback for For

	Router:
	- make the `path` reactive
	- decide what to do with useParams

	Posible pollyfills:
	- Object.groupBy, Promise.withResolvers, Object.hasOwn

	Playground:
	- LSP

POSSIBLE DE/OPTIMIZATIONS:

	CONSIDER ALWAYS:
	- keep the code readable, do not complicate it too much, even if faster
	- consistency above all
	- slow and simple is better than fast and super complicated

	COMPILER:
	- write a compiler to make the output smaller (possibly using `html`)

	CRAZY IDEAS:
	- change some for of for for in
	- change some toArray or for loops to be generators
	- functions that accept arguments of changing types should be split
