TODO:

	Documentation:
	- light theme
	- improve directory

	Playground:
	- LSP

	Miscellaneous:
	- typings
	- automated tests

	Router:
	- decide what to do with useParams


BUGS:

	Router:
	- is not scrolling when reloading to a hash tag when used with `lazy`

POSSIBLE FEATURES:

	classList:
	- the name of the class is not reactive

	Mount:
	- support mount points as a selector

	Components:
	- provide fallback for collapse

	Router:
	- make the `path` reactive

	mutable:
	- mutable doesnt track self, so it wont work with arrays, only works with the values
	- make it work with getters

	signalify:
	- make it work with getters

	Posible pollyfills:
	- Object.groupBy, Promise.withResolvers, Object.hasOwn

POSSIBLE DE/OPTIMIZATIONS:

	CONSIDER ALWAYS:
	- keep the code readable, do not complicate it too much, even if faster
	- consistency above all
	- slow and simple is better than fast and super complicated

	COMPILER:
	- write a compiler to make the output smaller (possibly using `html`)

	CRAZY IDEAS:
	- change some for of for for in
	- change some toArray or for loops to be generators
	- functions that accept arguments of changing types should be split
