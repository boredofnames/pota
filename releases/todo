TODO:

	Documentation:
	- light theme
	- improve directory

	Playground:
	- LSP

	Reactivity:
	- add maverick https://github.com/maverick-js/signals

	Miscellaneous:
	- typings
	- automated tests
	- check use of childNodes and see if can be changed to "children"
	- update html function
	- export mutable from pota/store
	- lit style props/attributes
	- update function

	Router:
	- decide what to do with useParams

BUGS:

	Router:
	- is not scrolling when reloading to a hash tag when used with `lazy`

POSSIBLE FEATURES:

	classList:
	- the name of the class is not reactive

	Mount:
	- support mount points as a selector

	Components:
	- provide fallback for collapse

	Router:
	- make the `path` reactive

	`html`:
	- reuse the cloned node instead of recreating one from scratch

POSSIBLE DE/OPTIMIZATIONS:

	CONSIDER ALWAYS:
	- keep the code readable, do not complicate it too much, even if faster
	- consistency above all
	- slow and simple is better than fast and super complicated

	COMPILER:
	- write a compiler to make the output smaller (possibly using `html`)

	CRAZY IDEAS:
	- change some for of for for in
	- change some toArray or for loops to be generators
	- functions that accept arguments of changing types should be split
