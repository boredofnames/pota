TODO:

	Documentation:
	- light theme
	- improve directory

	Playground:
	- LSP

	Reactivity:
	- add maverick https://github.com/maverick-js/signals

	Miscellaneous:
	- provide a rollup template
	- typings
	- make Scope lazy

	Router:
	- decide what to do with useParams

BUGS:

	Router:
	- is not scrolling when reloading to a hash tag when used with `lazy`

FUTURE FEATURES:

	classList:
	- the name of the class is not reactive

	Mount:
	- support mount points as a selector

	Components:
	- provide fallback for collapse

	Router:
	- make the `path` reactive

POSSIBLE DE/OPTIMIZATIONS:

	CONSIDER ALWAYS:
	- keep the code readable, do not complicate it too much, even if faster
	- consistency above all
	- slow and simple is better than fast and super complicated

	COMPILER:
	- write a compiler to make the output smaller (possibly using `html`)

	CRAZY IDEAS:
	- change some for of for for in
	- merge effects on equal reactive values
	- functions that accept arguments of changing types should be split
	- add to document fragment then to document (mutation observers)
	- make a class like untracked and then `new untracked(fn)`
	- only untrack if the the node is a custom element
	- change some toArray or for loops to be generators
