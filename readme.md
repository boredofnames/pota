# pota

pota is a small Reactive Web Renderer backed by a reactive library.
The reactive library used to be pluggable.

The renderer is compiler-less and can be used with an `html` function.
Also includes a babel preset for transforming JSX.

The API and core components, draw significant inspiration from Solid,
albeit things differ to an extent based on personal preferences.

pota prioritizes consistency and is subjectively easy to understand.
Its driven by developer needs, not benchmarks.
