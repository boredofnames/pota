# pota

pota is a small Reactive Web Renderer for Reactive Libraries.

Although its compiler-less, it includes a babel preset for
transforming JSX. Its abstracted API and components, allow you to
switch between reactive libraries at any time. Supported libraries
include: solid-js, oby, and flimsy.

The API and core components, draw significant inspiration from Solid,
albeit things differ to an extent based on personal preferences.

pota prioritizes consistency and is subjectively easy to understand.
Its driven by developer needs, not benchmarks.

Usage and documentation can be found on the website:
